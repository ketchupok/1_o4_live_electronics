# Csound version for LE Setup of "1 of 4"


This project is written in Csound 7-alpha and CsoundQt 7-alpha, and it requires these specific versions (or later) to run properly. It uses the new local sample rate feature introduced in Csound 7, which is not supported in earlier versions. For best compatibility and performance, it's recommended to use CsoundQt-7 alongside Csound-7.

The project is available in two versions: one coded in a traditional style and the other in a functional style. Both versions produce identical resultsâ€”the only difference lies in their coding approach, allowing users to choose based on preference or learning goals.

To run the project, first select the local sample rate, then start the engine. You must activate at least two oscillators. The system includes eleven oscillators for audio synthesis and one additional oscillator intended for use as an LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator).
