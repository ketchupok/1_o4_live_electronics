# 1_o4_live_electronics

This repository holds code/patches from our [artistic research on live-electronics](https://iwk.mdw.ac.at/hofmann/peek-etudes/). Specifically, our digital interpretation of the originally analog setup of ultra-sound oscillators + delays, that Pauline Oliveros used in 1966 to record the piece "I of IV" with a touch-sensitive keyboard.

Currently, you'll only find the Csound Version written by Param Izadyar here.
